# üéØ MaestroQA Ticket Upload ‚Äì Technical Assessment

---

## üß© Overview

This project demonstrates a full workflow for **loading customer-provided ticket data into MaestroQA via API**.

The process covers:
1. Reading and transforming client CSV data.
2. Authenticating securely using MaestroQA‚Äôs API.
3. Uploading tickets programmatically to a test account.
4. Verifying successful ingestion both through API responses and dashboard review.

## üß† Summary of Actions

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Data Preparation** | The client provided a CSV file (`CX Ticket Upload Data - Tech Assessment - Tobias Scott - Tickets.csv`) containing 10 support ticket records. The dataset included fields like `Support_Ticket_Id`, `Agent ID`, `Created_Date`, `Closed_Date`, `ticket_category`, `Csat_Score`, and more. |
| **2. Data Cleaning & Transformation** | Each row from the CSV was parsed using Python‚Äôs `csv.DictReader` and converted into a JSON-compatible format required by the MaestroQA API. Fields were normalized and mapped to the expected API schema. |
| **3. Authentication** | The MaestroQA API key was stored securely in a `.env` file and accessed using the `dotenv` package. Authentication was handled via a header parameter:<br>`apiToken: <API_KEY>` |
| **4. Upload Process** | Each ticket record was sent via a `POST` request to:<br>`https://app.maestroqa.com/api/v1/tickets`<br> Successful uploads returned **HTTP 201 Created**, confirming that all tickets were loaded successfully. |
| **5. Verification** | API responses confirmed success for tickets `ts-1009` through `ts-1018`. To confirm visibility, dashboard filters (Agent, Group, Date Range) were adjusted to ‚ÄúAll Time‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll Agents.‚Äù |
| **6. Result** | ‚úÖ All 10 tickets were successfully uploaded into the MaestroQA test account using the provided API key. |

## üßæ Process Summary (Concise)

> **In short:**  
> The customer‚Äôs raw CSV ticket data was transformed into the MaestroQA API format and uploaded using a secure Python script.  
> The process validated input data, authenticated via `apiToken`, and confirmed success via API responses (`201 Created`).  
> The resulting tickets (`ts-1009` ‚Üí `ts-1018`) now exist in the MaestroQA test account, ready for QA analysis or dashboard viewing.
